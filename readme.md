# C-to-MIPS-Compiler

This repository contains  the preprocessed C to MIPS assembly compiler. It was produced as part of EIE 2nd Year Instruction Architecture and Compilers coursework.It was completed in Spring 2021 by me (Haoran Wu) and Jeffrey Wong.

It is scored by  74% for the compiler (90%) and 100% for project management (10%) and passed 150 out of 202 tests. Within this code, we consider the limitating memory and conduct dynamic stack method to remove some of intermeadiate variable to make it approach the compiler in real life.
